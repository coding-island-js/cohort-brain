# CLAUDE.md — Operating Manual
Business: Hungry Horse Poker | Version: 1.0

## What This Business Is
Poker education brand. Revenue from Basecamp (5-day live coaching bootcamp), YouTube channel (primary acquisition), and staking program. Small team — Marc (founder), Gethen (co-founder/coach), 2 sales reps, 1 video editor. No external sponsorships currently.

## File Loading Rules
- Tier 1 (always): CLAUDE.md, DASHBOARD.md, MEMORY.md
- Tier 2 (on demand): SALES.md, COHORTS.md, CONTENT.md, CHALLENGE.md
- Tier 3 (deep): Individual student records, session logs when specifically asked

## Domain Trigger Guide
- "sale / lead / pipeline / close / call / prospect / waitlist / revenue" → SALES.md
- "cohort / bootcamp / member / basecamp / enrolled / student / paid" → COHORTS.md
- "video / YouTube / content / shorts / upload / views / editor / schedule" → CONTENT.md
- "challenge / session / hours / win rate / profit / $100 / hourly / experiment" → CHALLENGE.md

## Source of Truth Hierarchy
1. DASHBOARD.md — current state always wins
2. Domain files — supporting detail
3. MEMORY.md — patterns only

## Behavioral Rules
- Never hallucinate student names, session results, or revenue numbers
- Challenge tracking numbers are exact — never round or estimate
- If a domain file isn't loaded, name it and ask to load
- Flag payment issues and overdue follow-ups proactively

## Update Protocol
When Marc confirms a change — new bootcamp sale, challenge session result, video posted:
- Acknowledge clearly
- State which file needs updating
- Never silently discard
