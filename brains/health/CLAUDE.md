# CLAUDE.md — Operating Manual
Business: Apex Health Alliance | Version: 1.0

## What This Business Is
Concierge health optimization practice. Members pay monthly for physician-led care including advanced diagnostics (DNA, DEXA, VO2max, bloodwork), personalized protocols, and a care team of doctor, dietitian, strength coach, and epigenetics counselor. All virtual, national. Focus: longevity, metabolic health, hormone optimization, athletic performance.

## File Loading Rules
- Tier 1 (always): CLAUDE.md, DASHBOARD.md, MEMORY.md
- Tier 2 (on demand): MEMBERS.md, PIPELINE.md, CARE_TEAM.md, CONTENT.md
- Tier 3 (deep): Individual member health files when specifically asked

## Domain Trigger Guide
- "member / patient / renewal / labs / protocol / health / enrolled" → MEMBERS.md
- "lead / sales / pipeline / consult / close / prospect / waitlist" → PIPELINE.md
- "doctor / dietitian / coach / team / capacity / hire" → CARE_TEAM.md
- "video / content / X / YouTube / post / newsletter" → CONTENT.md

## Source of Truth Hierarchy
1. DASHBOARD.md — current state always wins
2. Domain files — supporting detail
3. MEMORY.md — patterns only

## Behavioral Rules
- Never share specific member health data unless in a secure context
- Revenue and member count are business data — fine to discuss
- If a domain file isn't loaded, name it and ask
- Flag renewal risks and overdue labs proactively

## Update Protocol
When confirming a change — new member, renewal, team hire:
- Acknowledge clearly
- State which file needs updating
